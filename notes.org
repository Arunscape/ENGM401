* Introduction
Chapter based study questions: use right side of brain
i.e. use common sense not exact numerical answers
answer using experience and your understanding of the concept
Some business problems have no clear answer unlike other engineering courses.
**  Chapter 1
capital expenditures: spending on behalf of the company

marketing
selling: know technical features and economic benefits

operations management: know enough for day-to-day management of the business

project management: proposals and justification

*** types of businesses
- Proprietorship: a business owned by one individual (small to medium size)
- Partnership: a business with more than one owner (small to medium size)
- Corporation: a legal entity created under provincial or federal law, entity is separate from its owners and managers (medium to large size, typically large)

the engineer must estimate or forecast
1. The required investment in a project
2. The product demand
3. A selling price
4. A manufacturing cost
5. A product life

- Principle 1: A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar
  time value of money
- Principle 2: All that counts are the differences among alternatives <<principle2>>
  - choices
- Principle 3: Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost
  - \(\delta R > \delta C\)
- Principle 4:  Additional risk is not taken without the expected additional return

summary: we did the course overview
and basic principles of engineering economics

* Chapter 3

**** Story: Take a lump sum of $17 Million, or $1 Million Instalments for 25 years?
***** "A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar" [[principle2]]
we need to compare the value of money recieved at different points in time

we use interest formulas to
*place different cash flows recieved at different times in the same time frame*
to compare them
** Definitions
- Market Interest Rate ::
    the interest rate quoted by financial institutions that refers to the cost of money to borrowrs, or the earnings from money to lenders
- Time Value of money ::
  - money has a *time value* because [[principle2]]
  - Money has both *earning power* and *purchasing power*
  (e.g. loss of value because of inflation)
- Principal ::
    the initial amouint of money involving debt or investments
- Interest rate ::
    the cost or price of the money expressed as a percentage rate per period of time
- Interest period ::
    a length of time that determines how frequently interest is calculated
- Number of interest periods ::
    specified length of time of the transaction
- Plan for receipts or Payments ::
    yields a particiular cash flow pattern over a specified length of time
- Future amount of money ::
    how much is paid over time, principal + interest
- \(A_n\) ::
    a discrete payment
- i ::
    interest rate per period
- N ::
    number of cash flows
- P ::
    sum of money at time=0 (present value/worth)
- F ::
    future value/future sum of money at the end of analysis
- A ::
    end of period payment (uniform series). This is a special case where \(A_1=A_2=...=A_N\)
- V_m ::
    equivalent sum of money at the end of a period n that considers the time value of money
  + \(V_0 = P\)
  + \(V_N = F\)
- Cash flow diagram ::
    + Upward is positive cash flow
    + TODO: insert pic from slide, 4-15
- End-of-period Convention ::
    We place all cash flow transactions at the end of an interest period
- Simple Interest ::
  \(F = P + I = P(1 + iN)\)
- Compound interest ::
  \(F=P(1 + i)^N\)
