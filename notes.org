* Introduction <2021-01-11 Mon>
Chapter based study questions: use right side of brain
i.e. use common sense not exact numerical answers
answer using experience and your understanding of the concept
Some business problems have no clear answer unlike other engineering courses.
**  Chapter 1
- <<<capital expenditures>>> :: spending on behalf of the company
- selling :: know technical features and economic benefits (marketing)
- <<<operations management>>> :: know enough for day-to-day management of the business
- <<<project management>>> :: proposals and justification

*** types of businesses
- Proprietorship: a business owned by one individual (small to medium size)
- Partnership: a business with more than one owner (small to medium size)
- Corporation: a legal entity created under provincial or federal law, entity is separate from its owners and managers (medium to large size, typically large)

the engineer must estimate or forecast
1. The required investment in a project
2. The product demand
3. A selling price
4. A manufacturing cost
5. A product life

6. <<<Principle 1>>> :: A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar
   (time value of money)
7. <<<Principle 2>>> :: All that counts are the differences among alternatives
   - choices
8. <<<Principle 3>>> :: Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost
   - \(\delta R > \delta C\)
9. <<<Principle 4>>> ::  Additional risk is not taken without the expected additional return

summary: we did the course overview
and basic principles of engineering economics

* Chapter 3 <2021-01-13 Wed>
** Story: Take a lump sum of $17 Million, or $1 Million Instalments for 25 years?

"A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar" time value of money
we need to compare the value of money received at different points in time

we use interest formulas to
*place different cash flows received at different times in the same time frame*
to compare them
** Definitions
+ Market Interest Rate ::
    the interest rate quoted by financial institutions that refers to the cost of money to borrows, or the earnings from money to lenders
+ <<<Time Value of money>>> ::
  - a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because the dollar today can earn interest
  - money has both *earning power* and *purchasing power*
    + earning power :: it can earn more money over time
    + purchasing power :: loss of value because of inflation over time

    (e.g. loss of value because of inflation)
+ <<<Principal>>> ::
    the initial amount of money involving debt or investments
+ <<<Interest rate>>> ::
    the cost or price of the money expressed as a percentage rate per period of time
+ <<<Interest period>>> ::
    a length of time that determines how frequently interest is calculated
+ Number of interest periods ::
    specified length of time of the transaction, denoted as *N*
+ <<<Plan for receipts or Payments>>> ::
    yields a particular cash flow pattern over a specified length of time
+ <<<Future amount of money>>> ::
    how much is paid over time, principal + interest
+ A_n :: a discrete payment or receipt occurring at the end of some interest period
+ i :: interest rate per period
+ N :: number of cash flows
+ P :: Principal amount, or the
    sum of money at time=0 (present value/worth)
+ F :: Future value/future sum of money at the end of analysis
+ A :: end of period payment (uniform series) that continues for N periods.
    This is a special case where \(A_1=A_2=...=A_N\)
+ V_n :: equivalent sum of money at the end of a period n that considers the time value of money
  + \(V_0 = P\)
  + \(V_N = F\)
+ Cash flow diagram ::
  + Upward is positive cash flow

    [[./converted_images/cash_flow_diagram.jpg]]

+ <<<End of period Convention>>> ::
    We place all cash flow transactions at the end of an interest period
+ <<<Simple Interest>>> :: charging an interest rate only on the principal
  \(F = P + I = P(1 + iN)\)
+ <<<Compound interest>>> :: charging interest on the initial sum and any previously accumulated unpaid interest
  \(F=P(1 + i)^N\)

** Economic Equivaluence
- One payment over time, what is the equivalent amount in the future?
- principle 1
  - equivalence calculations to compare alternatives need the same timeline
- principle 2 equivalence depends on interest rates
- principle 3 equivalence calculations may require the conversion of multiple payment cash flows to a single cash flow
- principle 4 equivalence is maintained regardless of point of view, either from the leadder or from the borrower

** Examples

- Plan 1
  + Principal: $20 000
  + Loan origination fee: $200
  + Interest rate: 9%
  + Interest period: 1 year
  + Number of interest periods: 5
  + Fee payment now plus equal annual payments
- Plan 2
  + Principal: $20 000
  + Loan origination fee: $200
  + Interest rate: 9%
  + Interest period: 1 year
  + Number of interest periods: 5
  + Fee payment now plus a single payment in year 5

notice how you pay $31 more by opting to pay the interest later

- option 1
  use the compound interest formula and apply it to each $100 disbursement
  #+begin_src python :noweb no-export :exports both
  <<imports>>
  return sum([fv_compound(100, 0.1, i) for i in range(3)])
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 331.0

- option 2
  a single disbursement of $331

*** TODO Extra Example (l3 page 14)
you signed a load agreement with the following terms
- borrowed amount: $2124.34
- monthly interest rate: 1%
- payment = $100 per month for 24 months
