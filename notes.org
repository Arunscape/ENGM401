* Introduction <2021-01-11 Mon>
Chapter based study questions: use right side of brain
i.e. use common sense not exact numerical answers
answer using experience and your understanding of the concept
Some business problems have no clear answer unlike other engineering courses.
**  Chapter 1
- <<<capital expenditures>>> :: spending on behalf of the company
- selling :: know technical features and economic benefits (marketing)
- <<<operations management>>> :: know enough for day-to-day management of the business
- <<<project management>>> :: proposals and justification

*** types of businesses
- Proprietorship: a business owned by one individual (small to medium size)
- Partnership: a business with more than one owner (small to medium size)
- Corporation: a legal entity created under provincial or federal law, entity is separate from its owners and managers (medium to large size, typically large)

the engineer must estimate or forecast
1. The required investment in a project
2. The product demand
3. A selling price
4. A manufacturing cost
5. A product life

6. <<<Principle 1>>> :: A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar
   (time value of money)
7. <<<Principle 2>>> :: All that counts are the differences among alternatives
   - choices
8. <<<Principle 3>>> :: Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost
   - \(\delta R > \delta C\)
9. <<<Principle 4>>> ::  Additional risk is not taken without the expected additional return

summary: we did the course overview
and basic principles of engineering economics

* Chapter 3 <2021-01-13 Wed>
** Story: Take a lump sum of $17 Million, or $1 Million Instalments for 25 years?

"A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar" time value of money
we need to compare the value of money received at different points in time

we use interest formulas to
*place different cash flows received at different times in the same time frame*
to compare them
** Definitions
+ Market Interest Rate ::
    the interest rate quoted by financial institutions that refers to the cost of money to borrows, or the earnings from money to lenders
+ <<<Time Value of money>>> ::
  - a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because the dollar today can earn interest
  - money has both *earning power* and *purchasing power*
    + earning power :: it can earn more money over time
    + purchasing power :: loss of value because of inflation over time

    (e.g. loss of value because of inflation)
+ <<<Principal>>> ::
    the initial amount of money involving debt or investments
+ Interest rate ::
    the cost or price of the money expressed as a percentage rate per period of time
+ <<<Interest period>>> ::
    a length of time that determines how frequently interest is calculated
+ Number of interest periods ::
    specified length of time of the transaction, denoted as *N*
+ <<<Plan for receipts or Payments>>> ::
    yields a particular cash flow pattern over a specified length of time
+ <<<Future amount of money>>> ::
    how much is paid over time, principal + interest
+ A_n :: a discrete payment or receipt occurring at the end of some interest period
+ i :: interest rate per period
+ N :: number of cash flows
+ P :: Principal amount, or the
    sum of money at time=0 (present value/worth)
+ F :: Future value/future sum of money at the end of analysis
+ A :: end of period payment (uniform series) that continues for N periods.
    This is a special case where \(A_1=A_2=...=A_N\)
+ V_n :: equivalent sum of money at the end of a period n that considers the time value of money
  + \(V_0 = P\)
  + \(V_N = F\)
+ Cash flow diagram ::
  + Upward is positive cash flow

    [[./converted_images/cash_flow_diagram.jpg]]

+ <<<End of period Convention>>> ::
    We place all cash flow transactions at the end of an interest period
+ <<<Simple Interest>>> :: charging an interest rate only on the principal
  \(F = P + I = P(1 + iN)\)
+ <<<Compound interest>>> :: charging interest on the initial sum and any previously accumulated unpaid interest
  \(F=P(1 + i)^N\)

** Economic Equivaluence
exists between individual cash flows and/or patterns of cash flows that have the *same economic effect* and could therefore
be traded for one another. Even though the amounts and timing of the cash flows might differ, the appropriaate interest rate
may make them equivalent
- One payment over time, what is the equivalent amount in the future?
- principle 1
  - equivalence calculations to compare alternatives need the same timeline
- principle 2 equivalence depends on interest rates
- principle 3 equivalence calculations may require the conversion of multiple payment cash flows to a single cash flow
- principle 4 equivalence is maintained regardless of point of view, either from the leadder or from the borrower

** Types of cash flows
[[pdf:./notes/lecture/markup/2021a L3 Economic Equivalence Single Cashflow (with notes).pdf::20][5 Types of Cash Flows Diagrams]]
TODO: insert formula sheet
- Single cash flow :: a single present or future cash flow
  - Compound Amount Factor :: (F/A, i, N)
    \( (F/P, i, N) = (i+1)^N\)
    - computes the equivalent future value F, given a present value P
  - Present Worth Factor :: (P/A, i, N)
    \(P/F, i, N = \frac{1}{(1+i)^N}\)
    - calculates the equivalent present value P given a future falue
  - the interest rate \(i\) and the \(P/F\) factor are also referred to as the <<<discount rate>>> and <<<discounting factor>>>
- Equal (uniform) series :: (uniform) a series of cash flows of equal amounts at regular intervals
- Linear Gradient Series :: a series of cash flows increasing or decreasing by a fixed amount at regular intervals
- Geometric Gradient Series :: a series of cash flows increasing or decreasing by a fixed percentage at regular intervals
  - aka compounding series
- Irregular (Mixed) Series :: a series of cash flows exhibiting no overall pattern
  + there still might be patterns for portions of the series, but overall there is no pattern
- Sinking Fund Factor :: (A/F, i, N)
  - a sinking fund is an interest bearing account into which a fixed sum is deposited each interest period
  - it is commonly established for the purpose of replacing fixed assets or retiring corporate bonds
- Capital Recovery Factor :: (A/P, i, N)
  - used to determine the revenue requirements needed to address the upfront capital costs for projects
  - A/P factor is referred to as the <<<annuity>>> and indicates a series of payments of a fixed or constant amount for specified number of periods
  - limiting case when N -> infinity ; A=P*i
- Present Worth Factor :: (P/A, i, N)
  - What would you have to invest now in order to withdraw A dollars at the end of each of the next N periods?
- Linear Gradient Series ::
  - Gradient to equal payment series conversion factor (A/G, i, N)

** Story: Mortgages
Canadians have the choice of using a variable-rate mortgage or a fixed-rate mortgage to finance their homes.The interest rate charged on a variable-rate mortgage is tied to the prime rate, which is adjusted from time to time.A fixed-rate mortgage charges a fixed interest rate over a specified period of time

- nominal interest rate :: a stated rate of interest for a given period (usually a year)
  - a.k.a. APR
  - the yearly cost of a loan expressed as a percentage
  - 18% APR compounded monthly means
    1. each month the bank will charge 1.5% interest on an unpaid balance
    2. you will earn 1.5% interest each month on your remaining balance if you deposited money

- effective interest rate :: the actual rate of interest, which accounts for the interest amount accumulated over a given period
  - effective annual interest rate is the rate that truly represents the interest earned or paid in one year
    + compounding within the year is considered
  - The 18% APR compounded monthly means the bank will charge 1.5% interest on any unpaid balance at the end of each month. Therefore, the 1.5% rate represents the effective interest rate per month. On a yearly basis, you are looking for a cumulative rate —1.5% each month for 12 months.

  - r = nominal interest rate per year
  - M = number of compounding periods per year
  - i_a = effective annual interest rate

    \[i_a = (1 + \frac{r}{M})^M - 1\]

    when \(M \to \infty, i_a = e^r - 1\)
- effective interest rates per payment period ::
  we can generalize the effective annual interest rate formula to compute the effective interest rate for periods of any duration
  + M = number of compounding periods per year
  + C = number of compounding periods per payment period
  + K = number of payment periods per year
  + \(M=CK\)

  \[i = (1 + \frac{r}{m})^C -1 = (1+\frac{r}{M})^{\frac{M}{K}} -1\]

  - continuous compounding ::

\[i_e = e^{\frac{r}{K}} -1\]

r/K is per payment period

- when payment period is equal to compounding period (M=K => C=1)
  1) Identify number of compounding periods (M) per year
  2) compute the effective intereswt rate per payment period (i)
     \(i=r/M\)
  3) determine the total number of payment periods (N)
     \(N=M \times (number of years)\)

- compounding occurs at a different frequency from the payment frequency
  1) compounding is more frequent than payments
  2) compounding is less frequent than payments
     - usually a bad idea because there's no benefit from paying earlier when that money could be making interest for you

- changing interest rates
  When an equivalence calculation extends over several years, more than one interest rate may be applicable to properly account for the time value of money.

  consider variable interest rates in
  a) single payments
  b) single payments and a series of cash flows

** Examples
*** Savings Account With Interest Rate of 9% Compounded Quarterly
You deposit $10,000 in a savings account with an APR of 9% compounded quarterly. The interest rate per quarter is 2.25% (9%/4).

*** Example: Find i_a given different M values

Given an APR value of 15% compounded annually, semi-annually, monthly, daily, or continuously, find the annual effective interest rate in each case.

1. annually: i_a = APR = 15%
2. semi annually m = 2 i_a = (1+15%/2)^2 - 1 = 15.563%
3. monthly m=12 i_a = (1 + 15%/2)^12 = 16.0755%
4. m = 365
5. continuously I_a =


Takeaway: the more often you compound, the higher the interest rate


*** Example 4.1 Determining the Compounding Frequency

- r = 3.5%
- i_a (APY) = 3.53%
- P = $100 000
- N = 2 years

  compounding frequency assumed is

  \(0.0353 = (1 + \frac{0.0350}{M})^M -1\)
  \(M=2\)

  total balance 2 years later:
  \(F = 100000(F/P, 3.53%, 2) - 107.185\)

*** Example 4.2 Effective rate per payment period
