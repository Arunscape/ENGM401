Chapter based study questions: use right side of brain
i.e. use common sense not exact numerical answers
answer using experience and your understanding of the concept
Some business problems have no clear answer unlike other engineering courses.

# Chapter 1
capital expenditures: spending on behalf of the company

marketing
selling: know technical features and economic benefits

operations management: know enough for day-to-day management of the business

project management: proposals and justification

## types of businesses
- Proprietorship: a business owned by one individual (small to medium size)
- Partnership: a business with more than one owner (small to medium size)
- Corporation: a legal entity created under provincial or federal law, entity is separate from its owners and managers (medium to large size, typically large)

1. The required investment in a project
2. The product demand
3. A selling price
4. A manufacturing cost
5. A product life

- Principle 1: A nearby penny is worth a distant dollar
  time value of money
- Principle 2: All that counts are the differences among alternatives
  - choices
- Principle 3: Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost
  - $\delta R > \delta C$
- Principle 4:  Additional risk is not taken without the expected additional return

summary: we did the course overview
and basic principles of engineering economics
